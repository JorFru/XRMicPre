### Project on standby state. I already have a X32.

Mic preamp module for a poor man's digital mixer

History:
Behringer's XR12 and XR16 are a very powerful and cheap digital mixers, but don't have enough mic preamps for some applications.

This project allows you to get the full performance of this mixers on live and studio applications.
